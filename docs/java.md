## The Eclipse Jetty Project

Eclipse Jetty is a lightweight, highly scalable, Java-based web server and
Servlet engine. Jetty's goal is to support web protocols (HTTP/1, HTTP/2,
HTTP/3, WebSocket, etc.) in a high volume low latency way that provides maximum
performance while retaining the ease of use and compatibility with years of
Servlet development. Jetty is a modern fully asynchronous web server that has a
long history as a component oriented technology, and can be easily embedded into
applications while still offering a solid traditional distribution for webapp
deployment.
